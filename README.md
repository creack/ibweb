An Interactive Broker web viewer in python


IbPy
-----
It is base on IbPy library (http://code.google.com/p/ibpy) which is basicaly a java2python translation.
As the library is not maintained anymore, I applied a couple of patch to the latest stable version.
You will find this patched version in ./ibpy. To install the library, simply do "python setup.py install" (as root)
